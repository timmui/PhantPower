# PhantPower
<h2>Smart IoT Power Outlet</h2>

PhantPower is a smart outlet that removes all phantom power from charging smartphones, tablets and laptops. The outlet can also be turned on or off from anywhere in the world using a Pebble, Myo, Android device, or computer. 

Each app is in their own respective branch.

PhantPower uses a Sparkcore and a Sparkcore relay shield to control the outlet. The apps for the Myo and the pebble were built for android (java, xml). The pebble application was built in cloudpebble (c), and the desktop app was built with python. All communications between devices are done through REST.

Fun fact, PhantPower can be controlled with Yo! and IFTTT.
